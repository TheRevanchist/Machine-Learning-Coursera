Machine-Learning-Coursera
=========================

First seven assignment (haven't done the eighth assignment yet) on the Machine Learning course from Coursera.
The Course was given from professor Andrew Ng of Stanford University and Baidu. Codes are on MATLAB/Octave.

If you need the code, I would highly recommend to read it a few times until you understand everything, instead of just
copy-pasting it. Anyway, that is up to you :)
